# high_frequency_limit_order_book_dynamic_prediction
This project works on a paper which models the high frequency limit order book dynamics. We would like to predict the ask-bid-crossing and mid-price movement in the limit order book. We implemented SVM model in our project. The data is stock future index from the Chinese financial market.
